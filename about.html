  <h2>About Us:</h2>
  <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
    Welcome to <b>The Blood Dragon Cult</b>, also known as <b>CVLT_53</b>, a society devoted to the enigmatic
    power and allure of the "Red Vienna." Inspired by the rare and awe-inspiring appearance of the crimson embodiment of the
    vtuber Vienna, we are more than just followers; we are devoted
    seekers of the blood-bound truth she embodies.
  </p>
  <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
    For us, <b>"Red Vienna"</b> is a symbol of transcendence, strength, and primal connection. She
    represents the fiery determination to rise above the mundane and the boundless energy that
    flows through life itself. Through her, we seek unity, enlightenment, and the courage to break our
    limits.
  </p>
  <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
    Though our rituals may seem esoteric, each is a step toward embracing the undying flame she
    ignited within us. Ours is not a path for the faint of heart—it is for those who are ready to embrace
    the scarlet glow of Red Vienna's radiant power.

    <b>1. The Offering of the Scarlet Flame:</b>
    &emsp;A symbolic ritual involving the offering of a few drops of blood
    (for legal reasons, extracted safely and consensually)
    onto a crimson altar. This is done while reciting passages of devotion to Red Vienna's courage
    and power, asking for strength and guidance.
    <b>2. The Blood of the Covenant:</b>
    &emsp;A gathering held under moonlight where members share their aspirations and fears, using
    small crimson sigils carved on their hands to symbolize unity. This ritual is said to forge
    bonds as strong as dragonsteel and a collective connection to Red Vienna’s essence.
    <b>3. The Hour of Transcendence:</b>
    &emsp;Followers meditate on Red Vienna’s fiery form, surrounded by imagery of her dragon form and crimson
    light. This practice focuses on channeling her energy into their lives, seeking clarity
    and transformation through visualization.

          <b>4. The Draconic Hunt:</b>

          Followers <b>"pursue"</b> any heretics from our long list, that shall, under no circumstances,
          be digitized. <b>"Caught"</b> heretics will be branded by <b>“the dragon’s flame”</b>.
          This hunt represents Red Vienna's pursuit of power and her all seeing greatness.
          <br><b>5. Crimson Days of Devotion:</b>
          &emsp;On anniversaries of Red Vienna's emergence, followers dress in red and perform acts of
          sacrifice. This doesn’t involve any harm to the followers participating,
          but rather showing their successes in the <b>"hunt"</b>. After unsuccessful <b>"hunts"</b>
          giving up something meaningful—whether time, comfort, or symbolic tokens
          of attachment—as a gesture of devotion are accepted by our goddess.
